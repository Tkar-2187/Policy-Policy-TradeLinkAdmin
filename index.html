# Privacy Policy for TradeLink Admin App

**Last Updated:** July 22, 2025

At TradeLink, we are dedicated to protecting the privacy and security of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you utilize the TradeLink Admin mobile application (“App”). By accessing the App, you acknowledge and agree to the practices outlined herein.

## Information We Collect

TradeLink Admin App collects certain information to ensure its proper functionality and to provide a seamless user experience. When you sign in, we gather your email address and password through Firebase Authentication to secure your account access. If you enable biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or face recognition, the App uses the `local_auth` package to verify your identity locally on your device, without storing or collecting your biometric data. We also obtain a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token from your device to deliver push notifications related to orders and significant events. As an admin, you may set a 4-digit security PIN to protect access to sensitive areas, such as the KBZ Details Management page, which is stored securely in Firestore. Additionally, the App allows you to manage and store KBZ bank account numbers, KPay QR code images, and associated nicknames, all saved in Firestore and Firebase Storage. Data entered for price calculations, including various values and totals, is associated with specific dates and stored in Firestore. Similarly, daily balance calculation data you input is maintained in Firestore. The App also retrieves and enables you to manage user orders from Firestore, including viewing details, updating statuses (e.g., from “pending” to “ongoing”), and uploading confirmation screenshots.

## How We Use Your Information

The information collected by the TradeLink Admin App is utilized to enhance your experience and support its core functions. Your account details are used to authenticate your identity and manage access to the App’s features, ensuring only authorized administrators can perform critical tasks. Order-related data enables you to accept, manage, and complete user orders, verify payments, and send confirmation details to users. Push notifications keep you informed about new orders, status changes, and any promotional messages you choose to distribute. The security PIN and other measures are implemented to protect sensitive financial data within the App, adding an extra layer of security for your administrative duties.

## Information Sharing

TradeLink is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information. We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent. However, we may share data with trusted third-party providers, such as Firebase (operated by Google), who assist in operating the App and delivering services, provided they adhere to strict confidentiality agreements. Disclosure may also occur when required by law or to protect the rights, safety, or property of TradeLink, its users, or others, in accordance with legal obligations.

## Data Security

Protecting your data is a fundamental priority for TradeLink. We employ the robust security features of the Firebase platform, including Firebase Authentication, Firestore Security Rules, and Firebase Storage Security Rules, to safeguard your information against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. All data transmitted to Firebase services is encrypted, and we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure its integrity and security.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Any revisions will be indicated by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document. Significant changes will be communicated to you through the App or other suitable channels, ensuring you remain aware of how your information is handled.

## Disclaimer of Liability

TradeLink shall not be held liable for any losses or damages arising from your failure to comply with this Privacy Policy or the associated Terms of Use. This includes, but is not limited to, losses resulting from technical failures, unauthorized access due to negligence in securing your account, or misuse of the App’s features. Your acceptance of these terms acknowledges this limitation of liability.

## Terms of Use

By using the TradeLink Admin App, you agree to be bound by the Terms of Use, which complement this Privacy Policy. Access is restricted to authorized administrators with an “admin” role, controlled via Firebase Authentication. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and security PIN, as well as managing user orders accurately and timely. Unauthorized use, interference with the App’s integrity, or sharing user data with third parties is strictly prohibited. For full details, please refer to the Terms of Use document.

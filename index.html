# Privacy Policy for TradeLink Admin App

**Last Updated:** July 22, 2025

At TradeLink, we prioritize the privacy and security of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the TradeLink Admin mobile application (“App”). By accessing and using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## Information We Collect

To provide a seamless and secure experience, the TradeLink Admin App collects specific information necessary for its functionality. When you sign in, we gather your email address and password through Firebase Authentication to ensure secure access to your account. If you opt to use biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or face recognition, the App utilizes the `local_auth` package to verify your identity locally on your device; your biometric data is neither collected nor stored by TradeLink. For push notifications, we obtain a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token from your device to deliver timely updates about orders and other critical events. As an admin, you may set a 4-digit security PIN to protect access to sensitive sections, such as the KBZ Details Management page, which is securely stored in Firestore. Additionally, you can manage and store KBZ bank account numbers, KPay QR code images, and associated nicknames, all of which are securely saved in Firestore and Firebase Storage. The App also collects data related to price calculations, including various values and totals, which are stored in Firestore alongside the relevant date. Daily balance calculations you input are similarly stored in Firestore. Lastly, the App retrieves and manages user order information from Firestore, enabling you to view details, update order statuses (e.g., from “pending” to “ongoing”), and upload confirmation screenshots.

## How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used to enhance your experience and ensure the efficient operation of the TradeLink Admin App. Your account details are utilized to authenticate your identity and manage access to the App’s features, ensuring only authorized administrators can perform sensitive tasks. We leverage order-related data to enable you to accept, manage, and complete user orders, verify payments, and communicate confirmations to users. Push notifications keep you informed about new orders, status updates, and promotional messages you may choose to send to all users. The security PIN and other protective measures are employed to safeguard sensitive financial information within the App, providing an additional layer of security for critical operations.

## Information Sharing

TradeLink is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information. We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties without your explicit consent. However, we may share your information with trusted third-party service providers, such as Firebase (operated by Google), who assist in operating the App and delivering services, provided they adhere to strict confidentiality standards. Additionally, we may disclose your information when required to comply with legal obligations or to protect the rights, safety, or property of TradeLink, its users, or others.

## Data Security

Protecting your data is a cornerstone of our operations. We utilize the robust security infrastructure of the Firebase platform, including Firebase Authentication, Firestore Security Rules, and Firebase Storage Security Rules, to ensure your information is safeguarded against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. All communications with Firebase services are encrypted, and we implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to maintain the integrity of your data.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Any updates will be indicated by revising the “Last Updated” date at the top of this policy. Significant changes will be communicated to you through the App or other appropriate channels, ensuring you remain informed of how your information is handled.

        <h1>Privacy Policy for TradeLink Admin App</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 22, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your information is collected, used, and protected when you use the TradeLink Admin mobile application (“App”). This app is intended for authorized administrators only.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>To ensure the proper functioning of the App, we may collect the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Your email and password for secure sign-in via Firebase Authentication.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Token:</strong> A Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token to send push notifications about orders and other critical events.</li>
            <li><strong>Security and Financial Data You Manage:</strong> As an admin, you input and manage data such as a 4-digit security PIN, KBZ bank account numbers, KPay QR codes, nicknames, price lists, and daily balances. This data is stored securely in Firestore and Firebase Storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Order Information:</strong> The app processes user order data from Firestore, including order details, status, and confirmation screenshots that you upload.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected and managed information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Authenticate your access to the Admin App.</li>
            <li>Enable you to manage user orders, verify payments, and provide service confirmations.</li>
            <li>Deliver important notifications related to administrative tasks.</li>
            <li>Secure sensitive sections of the app with your PIN.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Biometric Authentication</h2>
        <p>With your explicit consent, the app uses your device's native biometric features (e.g., fingerprint, face unlock) for secure login, facilitated by the <code>local_auth</code> package. Your actual biometric data (fingerprint or face scan) is never accessed, collected, or stored by our App or servers; all verification is handled securely on your device.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting all data. We leverage the robust security of the Firebase platform:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>All data, including admin-managed details and user orders, is stored in Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage.</li>
            <li>Access to data is restricted by Firebase Security Rules to ensure only authorized admins can view and manage information.</li>
            <li>All communication with Firebase services is encrypted.</li>
            <li>The 4-digit PIN provides an additional layer of security for sensitive operations within the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personally identifiable information. Your data is not shared with outside parties except:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>With trusted third parties (e.g., Firebase by Google) who assist in operating our application under strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
             <li>When we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or a legal process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Administrator Rights</h2>
        <p>As an administrator, you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access and manage the data necessary for your role as outlined in this policy.</li>
            <li>Reset your password. For security reasons, account deletion must be requested through our designated support channel.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will update the policy modification date above. We may notify you through the app or by other means of any significant changes.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>For questions or privacy-related concerns regarding the Admin App, please contact the development team through the designated support channel.</p>

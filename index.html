## 1. Information We Collect

To ensure the proper functioning of the App, we may collect the following information:

* **Account Information:** Your email and password are used for secure sign-in via Firebase Authentication.

* **Device Token:** We collect a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token from your device to send you push notifications related to orders and other important events.
* **Security PIN:** You can set a 4-digit PIN to secure access to sensitive sections of the app, such as the KBZ Details Management page. This PIN is stored in Firestore.
* **KBZ Details:** As an admin, you can manage and store KBZ bank account numbers, KPay QR code images, and associated nicknames. This information is saved securely in Firestore and Firebase Storage.
* **Price Manager Data:** Data you input for price calculations, including various values (A, B, C, etc.) and totals, are saved in Firestore, associated with a specific date.
* **Balance Data:** Information related to daily balance calculations that you input is stored in Firestore.
* **Order Information:** The app fetches and allows you to manage user orders from Firestore. This includes viewing order details, changing an order's status (e.g., from 'pending' to 'ongoing'), and uploading confirmation screenshots.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

* **To Authenticate and Manage Access:** To securely sign you into the Admin App and control access to its features.
* **To Provide Services:** To enable you to accept, manage, and complete user orders, verify payments, and send confirmation details back to users.
* **To Send Notifications:** To deliver important alerts regarding new orders, status changes, and promotional notifications you send to all users.
* **To Enhance Security:** To protect sensitive financial data within the app by requiring PIN verification for access.

## 3. Information Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties without your consent. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our application or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law.

## 4. Data Security

We are committed to protecting your data. We leverage the robust security features of the Firebase platform, including Firebase Authentication, Firestore Security Rules, and Firebase Storage Security Rules, to help safeguard your information.
